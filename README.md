My first endeavor into OpenGL, this can be built by going into the build folder and running "$ cmake .." then "$ make" then "./my_proj"
after first commit running my_proj creates a red triangle
If the triangle renders as white, run the command "$ export MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.3" then "$ ./my_proj" to get the shader to run properly
