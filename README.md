# Cpp_OpenGL
OpenGL is a graphics library API. This is my first endeavor into OpenGL, this can be built by going into the build folder and running "./my_proj"
# Progress
First commit: 
creates a red triangle using arrays

Second commit:
Created basic.shaders file which now stores the info for the shader and made the implementations to play.cpp to use that file, as well as other small bug fixes.

Third commit:
creates a blue box, now uses Index buffers to store vertex information

=======
My first endeavor into OpenGL, this can be built by going into the build folder and running "$ cmake .." then "$ make" then "./my_proj"
after running "my_proj" you should be greated with a blue triangle.
